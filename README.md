# HQC Cryptosystem in SageMath (Python)

This repository contains an implementation of the **Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC)** public-key encryption scheme, built using [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/). It includes both encoding/decoding routines and illustrative cryptanalysis demonstrating known vulnerabilities.

## üîê What is HQC?

HQC is a post-quantum cryptographic scheme based on **code-based encryption**. It combines **Reed-Solomon** and **Reed-Muller** codes over GF(2^8), leveraging their concatenation to encode messages securely.

## üìÅ Files
