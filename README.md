# HQC Cryptosystem in SageMath (Python)

This repository contains an implementation of the **Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC)** public-key encryption scheme, built using [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/). It includes full encoding/decoding routines and demonstrations of known vulnerabilities to help understand its cryptographic behavior.

## 📚 Academic Purpose

This implementation was developed as part of my Master's thesis in cryptography. It serves both as a functional HQC cryptosystem and a study of potential misuse scenarios that break its security guarantees.

## 🔐 What is HQC?

HQC is a post-quantum cryptographic scheme based on **code-based encryption**, relying on **Reed-Solomon** and **Reed-Muller** codes over \( \text{GF}(2^8) \). It has been submitted to the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process.
